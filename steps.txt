To make your Go code run as a server and start receiving data from the HTML form, you'll follow these general steps:

1. Set Up the Go HTTP Server
You need to use the net/http package to create an HTTP server that listens for requests. This server will handle incoming data from the form.

Key steps:
Define routes (endpoints): You will create routes to serve the HTML page (GET) and process the form data (POST).
Serve the HTML page: A handler function will serve the form to the user when they access the page.
Process the form submission: Another handler function will capture the data from the form and pass it to your existing program logic.
2. Handle GET and POST Requests
GET request: When a user first visits the page, the server responds with the HTML form where they can type the input and select the banner.

POST request: When the user submits the form, the server receives the input (text and banner) as a POST request, and you process the form data.

3. Extract the Form Data
When the user submits the form:

The text they entered will be sent as part of the form data.
The banner they selected will also be sent.
You can extract this data in Go using r.FormValue("input_name") for each form field. This is equivalent to the arguments you had in the command-line version.

4. Run Your Program Logic
Once youâ€™ve extracted the data (text and banner) from the form, you need to pass this data into your ASCII art generation logic (which used to rely on command-line arguments).

5. Respond to the User
After generating the ASCII art using the provided input, you need to send the result back to the user. You can display it on the same page or redirect the user to another page with the result.

General Flow:
Start the server: Create an HTTP server that listens on a specific port (e.g., 8080).
Serve HTML: When a user visits the / route (GET), serve the HTML form.
Receive POST data: When the user submits the form, handle the POST request at the /ascii-art route, extract the form data (text and banner), and process it.
Display the result: After processing the data, display the result (ASCII art) back on the web page.
